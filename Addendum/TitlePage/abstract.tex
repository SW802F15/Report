The purpose of this project was to make a runner's running experience less tedious and more inspiring, by playing music which fits their running pace. 
The project is based on the research of Edworthy and Waring, which concluded that music tempo affects a runner's pace and enjoyment.
The project will produce an Android application capable of playing music, detecting step-per-minute, and navigation without looking at the screen.
The application will be developed through Extreme Programming, as we try to adapt it to our project.\\
