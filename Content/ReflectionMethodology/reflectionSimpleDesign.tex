\subsection{Simple Design}
Overall, we only wrote code for the functionality we needed. As a consequence, a single issue arose where we forgot that a method was not general, and therefore it was used incorrectly in that particular case. 

We find that we gained more from this practice than we lost implementing it. At times out habit, we tried to predict functionality in the future, which was never used.
