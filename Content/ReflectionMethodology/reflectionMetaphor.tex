\subsection{Metaphor}
The application icon, the project title or ``pacer'' can be seen as metaphors, however we never established a formal metaphor. This was not a problem because every group member had the same vision for the product. 

%In regards to the report, the visions for certain chapters could differ and therefore we established a common vision and discussed a metaphor for the report.
