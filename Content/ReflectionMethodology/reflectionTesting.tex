\subsection{Testing}
%\Christoffer{slice reflections from Test section and put here?}
Testing helped enforcing several other XP practises, namely refactoring, collective ownership, pair programming, and continuous integration. 

The XP practise of collective ownership was enforced when we wrote tests, since there was less risk that a change made by someone in the group broke the system unnoticed, since the test would detect it. This gave group members courage to change code written by others and thus allowed a feeling of ownership of all the code. 

Test also enforced the pair programming practise. It gave group members a common understanding of the task to be solved. This understanding was achieved by writing test cases together, before the actual implementation of the application itself began.

Likewise, continuous integration was enforced by testing. All test cases could quickly be run after a change was made, so as to be sure nothing had been broken.
