\section{Planning Game}
Planning is a useful tool.
We used it primarily as a tool for measuring our velocity, to get an overview of our progress, and to know if we were falling behind schedule.
Additionally it helps keep the project progressing as the customer desires, by allowing the customer to continuously create user stories, which should be implemented.
