\section{Planning Game}
Planning is a useful tool.
We used it primarily as a tool for measuring our velocity, to get an overview of our progress, and to know if we were falling behind schedule.
Additionally it helps keep the project progressing as the customer desires, by allowing the customer to continuously create user stories, which should be implemented.

\subsection{The Customer's Role}
The main responsibilities of the customer, as regard to planning, is to create user stories and prioritise in which order they should be implemented.
As stated in \Cref{def:onsitecustomer}, we used a surrogate customer, which meant we were responsible for the tasks normally appointed to the customer.

%User Stories
The first task we needed to do, was create the user stories.
The creation of the user stories went fairly easy, but we later found that these were much larger than desired.
We would therefore split them into several smaller user stories.
\Alexander{We really do not have more for user stories?}

%Prioritising
After the user stories was estimated, it was our responsibility as surrogate customers, to prioritise in what order the user stories should be implemented.
Usually we prioritised them as we suspect an on-site customer would, according to cost/benefit.
However, after the basics modules of the program was implemented, we started letting our developer hearts influence the decisions.
We started to prioritise the user stories by novelty, which essentially means by what we found new and interesting to implement.
This caused the product to be more of a proof-of-concept product instead of the initial intended usable product.
Although the product did not end up as what was intended from the get go, it showed us that XP was capable of embrace change.
