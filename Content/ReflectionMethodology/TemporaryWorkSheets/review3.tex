\subsection{Review 2}
\paragraph{23rd February - 6th March}

The first day was spent on reading up on XP.
We did not label our issues on github with iterations. We should do that (we have the paper issues).


\textbf{Estimations:}
\begin{itemize}
\item We had trouble properly timing our tasks, so we started using everhour on the last day.
\item All work related time is tracked.
\item We will start counting work hours per person rather than per task.
\item We will not use estimations/time trackings from this iteration in our estimation of the next.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What Did We Accomplish?}
\begin{itemize}
\item We got stuck for a while on GUI - there were many unpredicted problems.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The basic GUI almost works for now, and effort should be greatly reduced, so we can focus on other parts.
	\item We should have split this issue up in several subtasks.
	\end{itemize}
\item Overall we have a functioning (though unstable) music player.
\item About half of the tasks for this iteration were not done.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Status on Master}
\begin{itemize}
\item It is possible to get the coverflow out of sync.
\item App can crash if next/prev keys are spammed.
\item Overall functioning well enough for demonstration purposes.
\end{itemize}
