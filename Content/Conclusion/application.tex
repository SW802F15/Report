\section{Application}
%Current State:
An Android application was developed in this project to address the challenges stated in \Cref{chap:intro}. The first challenge was expressed as the following question:

%Q1: 
\begin{center}
\textit{How can we provide music with an appropriate tempo, compared to the current pace, to the runner through the use of a smartphone?}
\end{center}

It was found that it is possible to create an application consisting of several modules working together to achieve the desired result, i.e. an application that plays back music that matches the user's pace:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Music Player}: This module is the core of the application, responsible for playing the desired music. Using a GUI it is possible to navigate through a playlist manually, and with a combination of the build-in dynamic queue and the step counter module, it can automatically play back songs that match the user's running (or walking) pace.
\item \textbf{Song Scanner}: The song scanner is responsible for locating music on the device and maintaining a music library.
\item \textbf{Step Counter}: This module uses the device's sensors to calculate the user's steps per minute.
\end{itemize}

The user is expected to use the application while running, and in addition to the functionality, it would be an advantage to be able to control the application while using for its intended purpose. That requirement led to the second question:

\begin{center}
\textit{How can a smartphone application be operated without disrupting the runner's form and/or concentration?}
\end{center}

This was achieved by creating a non-graphical user interface, allowing the user to tap the screen, when it is turned off, to control the music player: play, pause, next, previous.


\subsection{Future Work}
In its current state, the application fulfils the requirements stated by the questions, but as with most software there are improvements to make. Some possible improvements are:

\paragraph{Better Flow}

\paragraph{GUI Improvements}

\paragraph{NGUI Improvements}

\paragraph{Manipulation of Music Tempo}

\paragraph{Training Programs}

\paragraph{Integration with Other Services}

\paragraph{Polishing Existing Features}


%\begin{itemize}
%\item Reading tempo from file, currently it relies solely on a online API to retrieve tempo.
%\subitem Alternatively analyse music file in order to discover tempo.
%\item Altering tempo live, could be helpful to small libraries.
%\item Manual edit of song metadata. 
%\end{itemize}

% interval programs
% online album cover
% integration with music streaming service
% fix cover flow
% head phone in / out
% fixed play


%Future Works:
% offline analysis
	% minor since we are customers. Why?
% adjust music speed
% settings should be expanded
	% editing of songs (IDx-tags (bpm etc.))
	% what more?

% true NGUI
% tactile feedback

\Ivan{Vedr. GUI: Vi kan diskutere hvor godt det er i forhold til brugbar/ikke brugbar information og feedback. Specielt i forhold til det ikke grafiske ui kan vi overveje en mere klar form for feedback ved f.eks. nummerskift (vibration?).}
