In this chapter, the development of the step counter module is explained. The chapter separated into user stories which were the basis for developing the step counter, technology explorations made, implementation of the counter and lastly methodology observations made in regards to XP during the development of the step counter. 

In our implementation of the step counter we decided to split the task into a data collection task, testing of algorithm task and an implementation on android task. The reason for doing so is that it makes sense to test different algorithms on the same data set if they are to be compared.
