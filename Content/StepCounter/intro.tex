In this chapter, the development of the step counter module is explained. The chapter separated into user stories which were the basis for developing the step counter, technology explorations made, implementation of the counter and lastly methodology observations made in regards to XP during the development of the step counter. 

In our implementation of the step counter we decided to split the task into a data collection task, testing of algorithm task and an implementation on android task. The reason for doing so is that our normal approach of writing tests, code, and then run the test is unsuited for implementing a step counter. This is because the running of tests cannot be automated as it requires a person to move around with the smartphone.\Ivan{"This is because the running of tests cannot be automated..." lyder ikke særlig sandsynligt. Det skal nok lige omskrives. Lidt tynd man må da kunne bruge lagrede data}
