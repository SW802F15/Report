\subsection{Algorithm Selection}
To compare algorithms against each other we looked at the precision with which an algorithm could predict the number of steps taken in a data set from a particular task. The algorithm we found to work best was an adaptation of the pedometer in \citet{zhao:pedometer}.

\paragraph{Algorithm Modification}
The algorithm in \citet{zhao:pedometer} is for a pedometer working directly with the ADXL345 chip. We, however, rely on a sensor listener on the android platform instead. This means a few differences in our measured data:
\begin{itemize}
\item Our data sampling frequency is significantly lower. 
\item Our data is filtered for noise.
\end{itemize}
