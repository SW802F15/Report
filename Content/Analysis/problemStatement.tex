\section{Problem Statement}
Running is a popular form of exercise, but can be found tedious and boring. This feeling as well as the results?? can be improved through music (cite). However one must be careful of what music is playing while running, because too slow music can decrease your efficiency (cite). Today many runners use their smartphones as music players, which enables us to customise the played music through the available sensors.
Our goal is to match song and running tempo which is best for the runner (cite).
