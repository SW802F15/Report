\section{Problem Domain}
As introduced our problem will occur in the domain of runners. 
This can be both outdoor and indoor.

Outdoor runners can be in running beside traffic and other dangerous objects, for which they need to listing to their surrounding.
For this safety critical situation we can assume the runner will take the appropriate precautions and use a headset without noise-cancellation.
Because of the immediate danger of the traffic, we must never force the runner to concentrate fully on the smartphone just to control it. 
This could cause the runner to be inattentive and run into traffic.

Outdoor runners can also run in nature rich environment away from traffic and other dangerous objects. 
However, in this environment the roads or paths used for running can be tricky, hence the runners concentration must be on the path.
Also this scenario restricts us to not occupy the runners concentration.

The third domain is on a treadmill in a gym.
