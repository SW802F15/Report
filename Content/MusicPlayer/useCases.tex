\section{User Stories}
The following are the most interesting user stories used to develop the Music Player module. Some of the stories depend on other modules: it is, for example, not possible to ``Play music files'' without the Song Scanner, which is described in \Cref{chap:songScanner}.

\story{Play music files.}{High}
{As a user, I, want to listen to the music files stored on my device.}
{\begin{itemize}
\item I am able to play a music file stored on the device.
\item I am able to regulate the volume when listening to the song.
\item I am only able to open music files with the application.
\end{itemize}}

\story{Navigate songs.}{High}
{As a user, I, want to be able to skip the current song, listen to the previously played song again. 
Further I want to be able to stop and/or pause the playing song.
It should also be possible to seek in the playing song.}
{\begin{itemize}
\item A \texttt{Next} button must exist, which skips to the next song.
\item A \texttt{Previous} button must exist, which skips to the previously played song.
\item A \texttt{Stop} button must exist, which stops the music.
\item A \texttt{Pause} button must exist, which pauses the music, so it can be resumed from the paused position.
\item A \texttt{SeekBar} must exist, which can seek in the playing song.
\end{itemize}}

\story{Keep playing when screen is off.}{High}
{As a user, I, would like to save power by turning off the screen while the music is playing.}
{\begin{itemize}
\item The music keeps playing after the \texttt{Power} button is pressed.
\end{itemize}}

\story{Adjust music tempo.}{High}
{As a user, I, want the music to match my pace even when the playing song's tempo is not exactly my pace.}
{\begin{itemize}
\item The application must be able to match my pace with appropriate songs, when the smartphone is held in either the hand, the pocket, or on the arm.
\end{itemize}}
