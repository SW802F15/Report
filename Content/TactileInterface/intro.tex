In this chapter, the development, implementation and relevant observations in regard to XP made while developing the non-graphical user interface (NGUI), are described. The NGUI makes it possible to control the play, pause, previous and next functionality of the music player by tapping anywhere on the screen.

The chapter contains a description of the user stories created, which acted as a basis for the development of the NGUI in regards to the requirements it should fulfill. Points of interest from its implementation are also described.
