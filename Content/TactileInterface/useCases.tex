\section{User Stories}
The user story on which the implementation of the non-graphical user interface was based on were as follows:

\story{Enable navigation with screen turned off}{High}
{As a user, I, would like to save power by turning off the screen while still being able to navigate songs when the screen is off.
A screen is turned off when the power button is pressed.}
{\begin{itemize}
\item The application can still be controlled after the \texttt{Power} button is pressed.
\item play, pause, stop, previous and next functionally should still be available with no graphical interface.
\end{itemize}}
