\section{User Stories}
The user story on which the implementation of the non-graphical user interface was based on is:

\story{Enable navigation with screen turned off}{High}
{As a user, I would like to save power by turning off the screen, while still being able to navigate songs when the screen is off.
A screen is turned off when the power button is pressed.}
{\begin{itemize}
\item Play, pause, stop, previous and next functionally should still be available after the \texttt{power} button is pressed.
\end{itemize}}
