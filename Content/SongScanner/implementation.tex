\section{Implementation}
This section should describe the programmatically interesting and relevant parts of the Music Player.

i.e. We found that trying to stop the music player while not loaded caused it to skip to next song. It was due to the fact this was an illegal action in that state, as seen in Figure (Android graph over mediaplayer states). We fixed this issue by implementing something, as seen in Listing (Code snipped of interesting code).
