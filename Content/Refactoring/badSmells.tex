\section{Bad Smells}
%what are bad smells?
According to \citet{code:smell}, a bad smell is

\end{center}

Examples of bad smells are duplicated code, and long methods. Below each of them are explained. 

\paragraph{Duplicated Code} is then when similar code structure occurs in multiple places in a program. Most of the time there is no reason to have nearly identical code in multiple places. Often, the code can be extracted, with little or no modified and a new method can be created which is simply called from all methods with the similar code. 

\paragraph{Long Methods} are likely to be harder to understand, see \citet[p. 64]{fowler:refac}, since readability also affects maintainability it is clearly an unwanted smell. Therefore it is usually desirable to break up a long method into multiple smaller ones. Usually all that is needed is to shorten a long method, is to extract the method and put the parts that seem to fit together in new methods.
