\subsection{Release Evaluation}
In addition to the components of 2nd Release, the 3rd Release included a non-graphical interface to answer the findings of the 2nd release. Every component stub had been replaced, so the application were properly connected. The application is now fully functional as a \textit{running pacer}, though new findings revealed new paths to improve the application.
