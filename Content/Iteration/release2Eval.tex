\subsection{Release Evaluation}
At the end of the 4th iteration the application had the desired components: Music player, a music library (referred to as the song scanner module), and a step counter. Each of the components worked on their own, but had not been properly connected, resulting in only the features \textit{music player} and \textit{step counter} being done; the \textit{running pacer} requires a combined effort from the other two features.
Overall, the application ended in a state that required few changes to bring a lot of value to the customer.
