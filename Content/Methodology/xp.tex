\section{Extreme Programming}
There is a lot of interest development methodologies in recent years \Kristian{find kilde, etv. omskriv}. One such methodology is XP (Extreme Programming) which we have chosen as a focus of the project, in this section we will look at our motivation for choosing XP, what we hope to accomplice and how we plan to do it.
	
\subsection{Motivation}

%  to learn to program in another way (the extreme way)
% keep track of progress
% create a better product (higher quality)
% be able to respond to change in requirements faster
% * why XP and not another agile method?
% 	XP adv: group size fits, iteration length, self-management
\subsection{Goals}
By using XP for this project we hope to achieve a number of goals:
\begin{itemize}
\item Achieving high test coverage.
\item Produce robust, high quality code.
\item Improve communication.
\item Acquire new skills in agile development.
\end{itemize}
% better code/product quality
% 	* thorough testing
% 	* robustness (compare to earlier projects)
% improved communication in the group
% 	better tracking of issues

When setting goals for the project it is also important to measure how well we achieve these goals. 
\paragraph{Testing Metrics}
When evaluating how well tested a software there is a number of methods available such as line coverage, branch coverage and ...
\Kristian{Vi skal baser dette på Test og Verification kurset}

\paragraph{High Quality Code}
There are many ways to define high quality code, such as lack of bad smells, good readability and simplicity etc...

\paragraph{Communication}
How to evaluate improvements in communication is going to be subjective.
